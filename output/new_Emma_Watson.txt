spoken about feminism
the more i have realized
the fighting for women's rights
has too often becomes not
with man hating if there is one thing
i know for sure
it is that this
to stop i thought his questioning generations a long time ago
when i was at
i was confused at being called

because i wanted to direct the plays that we would put on poor parents
but the boys were not
at fourteen i started to be sexual ized by certain elements
when it 
my golf friends started dropping out of our beloved sports
because they didn't want to appear much
when in eighteen
my male friends were unable to express the feelings
i decided
but i was a feminist
on the seemed uncomplicated to
but my recent research has shown me
that feminism has become an unpopular word
women
choosing


why has the word the came such an uncomfortable
i am from britain
and i think it is right that i am paid the same as my mill counterpart
i think it is right
but i should be able to make decisions about my own body
i think i think it is right
that woman be involved on my behalf in the policies and decisions that will affect my life
